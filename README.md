# CMB
Statistical Physics of Cosmic Microwave Background


In this project we are trying to analyze statistical properties of the
cosmic microwave background. The goal of this project is following up
the Gaussianity and non-Gaussianity of the CMB. There are two important method
that we are using. Crossing statistics and 2 dim genus statistics.
Also, There are theoretical results from all these statistics in order
to copare with simulations. Furthermore, Simulations for Planck
satellite is availabe from this source code.

*************************************************
cross_new.f90



Compute crossing statistics



genus.f90


Compute genus statistics


map.f90 + fft.f90

Generate Fractional Gaussian Noise based on the hurst exponent
